# SMU-Module-01-Challenge

## Description

This weekly challenge is a **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** they give you starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format. 
 

### Challenge Elements

challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.

Each Challenge contains the following elements:

* **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work.
* **Mock-up**: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

* **Submission**: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. 

## MY Task
This week is an odd-numbered week, so my Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
