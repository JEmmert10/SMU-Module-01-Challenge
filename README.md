# SMU-Module-01-Challenge

## Description

This weekly challenge is a **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** they give you starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format. I am challenged to make the code better, improve the overall state of the live site and help get the mock-up site back up to accessibility standards. 
 

### Challenge Elements

challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work.

Each Challenge contains the following elements:

* **User Story**: This is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.
* **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work.
* **Mock-up**: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

* **Submission**: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review.

## MY Task
This week my Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that I will begin with starter code that I need to modify. I started by fixing the html structure first, then moved over to the .css to make it match the html structure. Next, created my readme.md for the repository. Finally I submitted my live site and GitHub repository URL's to be graded. Both links to my live site URL, my GitHub repository URL and the starter code GitHub repository URL are linked in the credits.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
